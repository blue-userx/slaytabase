invite the bot: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=961824443653574687&permissions=0&scope=bot

## steps for adding/updating mods
1. first time? clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/OceanUwU/slaytabase --depth=1` (so that you don't download the entire commit history). otherwise just `git pull`
2. download the latest version of [my fork of modded spire exporter](https://github.com/OceanUwU/sts-exporter/releases)
3. launch ModTheSpire with BaseMod, my SpireExporter, and the mod(s) you'd like to add/update
4. in SpireExporter's mod config, disable "export vanilla items", and enable "export images"
5. create a directory called `gamedata` in this repo
6. on a profile where no beta art is enabled, create an export and move the `export` directory it creates into `gamedata` in this repo (delete/rename the old `export` if there's already an existing one)
7. if you want to add additional information that's not directly found in item descriptions you may add it to `extraItems.js` (there is a template at the bottom, copy and paste that)
8. (requires [node.js v16+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)) run `npm install` then `node alterExport.js` (this can take a while depending on how many files there are)
     
     - if the mod has a gigantic amount of art or if it has AI-generated art or it has art taken from external sources run the script with the `--no-images` flag i.e. `node alterExport.js --no-images`. if youre not sure whether you should do this or not just ask me
9. if you want your custom keywords to have emoji icons, add them to `emojis.js`
10. if the mod contains a character or a custom card colour, add data about them to `characters.js` (the number is a hex code converted to decimal)
11. make a pull request (make sure you aren't editing any of files of any other mods)

## setup for running/developing the bot
