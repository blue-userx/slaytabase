They dream, and their dreams are the stuff of nightmares. \n \n The Somnambulant has many ways of manipulating their deck, which can change drastically in the course of combat. Cards can be generated and exhausted en masse. It is up to the player to reshape their decks in beneficial ways. \n The most common way of changing the deck comes in the form of two special cards, both of which can only be created during combat. \n The card Dream will create new cards until your hand is full, all of which cost 0 energy this turn. The class of the cards generated depends on the intent of the enemy you are dreaming about: an attacking enemy will provide you with Ironclad cards, a buffing enemy with Defect cards, and a debuffing enemy with Silent cards. Dreams are powerful, but, since they are generated in your discard pile, will often take a while to get drawn. \n The card Nightmare does very little on its own. It is practically a curse, allowing you to apply 1 measly poison to an enemy, for the ungainly cost of 1 energy. They stay in your hand at the end of your turn, so at least you only have to draw them once. However, fill up your hand with too many Nightmares and there will be little space for those Dreams to pay off. Mostly, Nightmares are a drawback to an otherwise powerful effect. There are cards, however, that let you benefit from those Nightmares in your hand. \n \n The rest is up to you to discover.","mts_version":"3.8.0","sts_version":"01-23-2019","dependencies":["basemod","stslib"],"optional_dependencies":[]},{"name":"SpireLocations","version":"1.1.1","authors":["Pandemonium"],"credits":"","description":"Adds modifiers to nodes, with various effects.","mts_version":"3.18.2","sts_version":"12-22-2020","dependencies":["basemod","stslib"],"optional_dependencies":[]},{"name":"StSLib","version":"2.10.0","authors":["kiooeht"],"credits":"\n  Contributors: The_Evil_Pickle, Reina, Rin Camelia, erasels, EatYourBeetS, Jedi, Vex, Mistress Alison, Alchyr, Bryan, Pandemonium, NellyDevo, herbix \n  Translation: Jedi (Russian), Rita-B (ZHS), rainfoxest (ZHS, ZHT), Mwalls (ZHS), Tsurumaki Maki (Korean), Celicath (Korean), Diamsword (French), red5h4d0w (French)","description":"A collection of keywords and mechanics for other Slay the Spire mods to use.","mts_version":"3.24.0","sts_version":"12-18-2022","dependencies":["basemod"],"optional_dependencies":[]},{"name":"Stuff the Spire","version":"1.6.5","authors":["Lobbienjonsji (Code & Art)","McMake (Art)"],"credits":"The Rapublic Discord for card ideas: LightningLord2.71828183 for the Rend and Clean hard drive card idea.
